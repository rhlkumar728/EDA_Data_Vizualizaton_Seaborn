<b> </h1> EDA Explaination </h1> </b>
<b>

EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, 
often with visual methods. The goal of EDA is to understand the underlying structure of the data and to uncover relationships
among the variables. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process as it helps to identify patterns, anomalies, and outliers 
in the data, which can guide the development of more formal statistical models. EDA techniques include univariate analysis, 
bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis. Common tools used in EDA include histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heat maps.
